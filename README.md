## Post-Mortem

### Why

I made this project with some goals in mind:
- Learn how to apply transformations and detect collisions on a grid
- Use event polling in the DOM, and encounter possible performance limitations
- Make a game from scratch without too much framework

*Wireframe Draft*

### Challenges

- Limiting player rotation and movement from collisions within grid bounds
  - **Problem**: Implementing this feature was not hard in and of itself, but combining it
  with the feature I labelled "pressure", where player attachment to the board is delayed 
  proved trying. Sometimes the block would attach to the board "floating midair".
  - **Solution**: I needed to refactor the movement into a once-called function 
  every frame,
  instead of being called at various places.
- Writing overlays proved somewhat hard to manage
  - **Problem**: Overlays are all hard-coded into the html file. I did not approach UI in 
    a modular component fashion. This left all UI in an invisible state sitting in the middle
    of the board, preventing clicks getting to the right UI button or input.
  - **Solution**: I used a class to toggle the hide/show behavior. By setting pointer-events 
    to "none" when hidden fixed the layered issue, while it would be set back to "all" when shown.
    These kinds of problems will hopefully resolve itself as I use React, or attempt 
    to write future UI with greater finesse.
